r0001,2020-01-12,1714,5,Awesome,The color is a tad greener(turquoise) than it seems on the picture... it's indeed a cool color! When I'm out in the slopes people constantly asks me where I got my gear from. I've combinated the jacket with the 686 Mannual Bliss Insulated Pant in Orchid Denim.... sounds like it wouldn't be a good match but it's great!!!

r0003,2019-06-02,1938,5,A fit that's hard to find,"I am 5'11"" and have a pretty solid, athletic build from the Army. It's tough to find winter clothing that doesn't make me look the size of a man or have sleeves too short.This jacket is well-fitted to my figure, allowing for a slender, curvy outline. The length of the torso and sleeves are adequate for me, as well. I've had this jacket for over six months, and it's been holding up perfectly. The quality of the materials and design feels like a $300 jacket. I haven't had a problems with waterproofness or breathability. I got the one called Black Dot Pin, but it isn't actually black; it has a dark purple base, and the lighter accents are a light lavender.",122,1,0,0,0,0,,2019,6,2,6,121

It is a great wind-stopper, and the honey-comb inside material keeps the jacket from sticking to you if you sweat a lot. It is not as breathable as some other jackets, but it stops a chilly wind much better. Very comfortable and it is longer (on me, 5'4"") if you like that type of jacket.",79,1,0,0,0,0,,2021,5,6,3,79

Works Amazingly in the wind - I absolutely love the taped seams (especially when on the bike). The velcro around the wrists works wonderfully - I never have to be concerned with my gloves sneeking out. I love the higher neck that really helps out in the cold winds.

I recommend the Alpha SL and LT for active pursuits and the Beta SL as an around town/casual shell/jacket. The Alpha SL is superlight. The PacLite fabric is nice, although the LT has an even better feel (Pro-Shell). I definitely recommend the Alpha SL, expecially if you're on a budget.

It fits perfectly. I am 5'4"" and 120 and got the small and i can still fit a jacket underneath for layering. If you want to use this jacket for skiing or such, I would recommend sizing up because a thicker jacket underneath might be a little cramped. I love the sprig color (bright green...you cant miss me).

r0019,2019-01-25,2066,3,Perhaps I Overdid it a Little....,"I must say, I gave this rain jacket the ultimate test straight from the get-go. I took it on a month long trip to Venezuela were it encountered tropical thunderstorms and a drenching boat ride to Angel Falls. I was underwhelmed with the jackets ability to repel water in these conditions (it only could take a medium amount of water). It might be better for light rain and city livin'. I wouldn't recommend this coat for hardcore outdoor activities. I ended up returning it and got a beefier jacket instead.",90,0,3,1,1,0,,2019,1,25,6,90
r0020,2021-04-12,1258,5,Great for spring and fall,"This is a lightweight jacket that insulates very well for spring and fall. If you ordered it expecting a heavy down coat for winter, well, I guess you've already written a negative review. Just because it's lightweight doesn't make it ""flimsy"". Mine has held up very well and has not torn, it has good water resistance for not being a waterproof material, and I love how light it is. This is a perfect mid layer, and Arc'Teryx is good about sizing their clothing with function and layering in mind, so just order your normal size. I would recommend it for 20-50F degree weather, so it's quite versatile, but you'll want something warmer or another layer for the really cold temperatures. I've been told the hood looks ""adorable"" :)",128,1,0,0,0,0,,2021,4,12,5,128

Worn on top of a long underwear top, I was completely warm, even in 18 degree weather. During a snow storm, I didn't bother putting on my Gortex rain jacket because it kept me completely dry. It packs up really small (I kept it in the brain of my pack for easy access) and is super lightweight. I don't know how they did it but Arc'teryx designed a bombproof jacket that can keep the coldest human (me) warm and comfortable. Size/Color: I'm 5'7'' and 125lbs. I bought a medium in bud. I found the fit to be relaxed and ideal for layering. The color is bright but I love it.",125,1,0,0,0,0,,2020,7,17,4,125

r0024,2020-01-18,1708,5,Perfect mid layer!,"I have wanted a puffy for a long time now, and finally bit the bullet and bought this jacket in the color Bud. First impression was the color was a LOT brighter than it looks online - more of a very bright lime green rather than the pale lime green it appears to be. Whatever, still love the color. It's a bit thinner than I expected, but that doesn't change my opinion on this jacket at all, since it seems quite warm enough. Absolutely LOVE the wrist cuffs and as another reviewer said, it sports the best non-drawstring hood I've worn. I bought this thinking I would just wear this as a mid layer for cold weather hiking or skiing, but I actually wear this all the time now and it has become my every day jacket. I have worn it in light rain and it's just fine. It's great on its own: the cut and fit are perfect. What I like best about it, though, is that I can actually wear this under OR over another layer. (I have the Patagonia slopestyle hoodie and this jacket can go both ways with it, so it's very versatile - I've also worn it over bulky sweaters.) Last, it is extremely well made and very typical of the high quality that I'm used to from Arc-Teryx. Will be testing it out skiing this weekend. Highly recommend!",234,1,6,1,1,0,,2020,1,18,3,234
r0025,2020-01-15,1711,3,not that warm,"The atom makes a nice, light layer, but its not much of a cold-weather jacket. Wind flies through every seam. Every breeze sends cold air swirlign around my arms. And the fleece breathes way too much for me. The jacket keeps my back toasty and my head warm while my arms, armpits and shoulders freeze. Its an odd combination. The Atom must be meant for hot blooded people who need to dump lots of heat. The Atom would give them a sweaty back though, but they wouldnt be chilled by it. Good points: the jacket IS water resistant. its comfy. it has the best non-adjustable hood I've ever worn. its light. and the cuffs at the wrists are genius. Atom has a nice feminine silouette. But I disagree with another reviewer about sizing down. The jacket is close around the hips, and theres no way any woman with 40 inch hips could wear a medium as per the size chart. There isnt enough fabric to go around, and the fleece isnt THAT stretchy. I think the pockets would be stretched open if you wore a medium with anythigng more than 38 inch hips. It wouldnt be a good look. There IS a drawcord, so even if you picked a bigger size you could cinch it if you had to.",219,0,0,0,1,0,,2020,1,15,3,219
r0026,2020-01-06,1720,5,This jacket is awesome!,"I bought this jacket a few months ago and I'm still in love. I wear it mostly around town as an outer layer cause it looks good. But I recently started wearing it as a mid layer for cold resort days and as an outer layer for touring (I usually put a shell over it for the ride down). This thing is toasty - and despite the side panels - it pretty much blocks all wind. The waterproofing is reasonable, but I'm not too demanding on that front (I live in UT). It's also more breathable than I expected and I have found that it dries really quick. The hood is awesome and if you put it on and pop your hands in the pockets you will be warm in no time. The fit on this jacket is fantastic. I never feel like it inhibits movement. And the thing is definitely durable. I have stuffed it in backpacks and worn it constantly and it still looks brand new. I highly recommend this one.",173,1,0,0,0,0,,2020,1,6,4,173

r0028,2019-12-25,1732,4,pretty sweet but a little cold,Very comfortable and looks great. However I expect synthetic insulation pieces to be a little warmer. The fabric strech panels loose alot of heat and let wind in. Put a shell over it and it is better but it lacks loft to be a true winter heater.

r0029,2019-12-02,1755,4,"it's not you, it's me.","This is one classy jacket. Its incredibly flattering, well cut, dare i say tailored? It has these amazing stretchy panels on the sides and underarms, and the cuffs are really well done. The thing feels better than a second skin. In spite of this, I returned it. why? well it's just so light weight I don't trust it to be warm enough all by it's onesies for 30 degrees and below. Maybe im just too used to my 5yr old 10lb north face gortex insulated number. Plus, I saw the Golite Reverb on sale for half the price and snatched that up. The reverb is sturdier looking and just feels tougher than the atom. By all accounts the atom lt is actualy very warm and sturdy, maybe I'm just not ready for the technology where such warmth comes from something so light weight, silky smooth, and attractive. If you get this (and i recommend you do if you have the dough), you should probably also have some sort of a fleece layer underneath for hellishly cold days. and as for sizing, I'm 5'8, 120 lbs with very long arms and broad shoulders, and the medium was roomy. I'd say you could size down on this one.",206,1,0,0,0,0,,2019,12,2,5,206

r0034,2020-11-28,1393,5,great jacket,"The fit is perfect- tailoured enough to look good when wearing on its own and to wear under a shell, but still enough room for additional layers underneath. The cuffs are also great- made from elasticized material that stops any cold air from seeping in when raising your arms. Very warm. Down to -5C or so, I wear it around without a shell and am happy. For colder/wetter conditions, my gore tex shell comes on top. And so light! People constantly wonder how something so thin and light is warm, but somehow it is. It is nice to wear something that doesn't look or feel bulky but still be warm. Breathability seems good, but haven't yet tested it under extreme conditions ie ice climbing. Water resistant against light rain. I choose the non-hooded version because I planned to wear it under a shell during the winter anyway, in which case an additional hood would just be irritating. Also because I read that the hood was (unusual for arcteryx) ill-fitting.

It fits like gloves (xs for 5'3"" & 115lb) and moves with you because of the way it's constructed. It's warm enough by itself over a decent base-layer in Boston winter (avg. ~30F during the day) if you're walking a few steps between car and indoor or if you're being active.

The main body is a nylon wind-type shell that is lightly insulated, but it has stretch panels on the sides that are breathable. The cuffs are a soft lycra-type material and are very comfortable and work to seal out the wind. The jacket is so cozy, I don't want to take it off.

I was the only one that was bone dry at the end of the day. I got it in this very light blue color, which tends to get dirty real easily, but that's negligible. The only tiny detail that was a con for me, personally, was that the jacket wasn't as long as I would ideally like, the pockets are kind of small, and since its pro-shell gore-tex the jacket can be a little loud (I was told to take the jacket off during my road test because it was distracting!)

The main zipper is not two way, a major deal breaker for me and is awkward to work since it starts at the bottom edge of the jacket.The girlish styling on all these womens' jackets I find annoying. I want to stay dry and layer for cold and rainy weather, not show off my girlish figure. The waist hits me at the hips so is snug when it shouldn't be and yet is not as long as I'd like to block wind and rain.I love the way the hood works and the colour and the lack of velcro but those features are not enough for me to want to keep it.

It is so lightweight that you hardly feel like you are wearing anything, yet it gives you the perfect amount of coverage and wind protection. I just wore a tank under this but you can certainly layer on a colder day. I agree with the review below that it runs a little bit big but that would be a good thing if you want to wear it in cooler temps with a long sleeve shirt underneath.

However, it keeps me surprisingly warm, yet I never get too hot either- a perfect wind blocker. I find myself wearing it almost every day. It's cute too! Just a note...It does fit a little larger than other Arcteryx jackets(trim fit vs athletic fit- the trim fit is looser- go figure?) So if you're in between sizes, go smaller unless you want it on the looser side. I'm 5'6"" 130 lbs and the xs fits perfectly with a little room, but certainly not baggy.

The quality of the jacket is not up to Arc'teryx old standards (when they were made in Canada), the seams are a little rough and the materials don't seem quite as solid, but that might be because they're so high tech. I tested it bike riding on a cool day. The jacket is good for aerobic activity, it definitely kept me from overheating, but I was disappointed in how little wind it blocked. Granted, there's a lot of wind when you bicycle. On the other hand, if I weren't producing a lot of heat, I think it might not have kept me warm.

r0094,2020-11-26,1395,5,"Flattering, light and warm","Love this jacket. I'm not an athlete but I am active outdoors all winter. This is my primary work jacket for helicopter EMS in Colorado and it really performs. It is windproof and very water-resistant. As far as warmth is concerned, keep in mind that this is a softshell, and is designed with movement and athletic performance in mind... so it is not puffy, lofty, long or cozy. It will keep you comfortable when you're sitting around at 50 to 30 degrees. If you're working out, it will keep you warm down to the 10s or 20s if you have an adequate base layer (e.g., full-weight smartwool, medium-weight fleece, lightweight wool sweater).I also like how Arcteryx cuts their softshells. This is a body-skimming design with a feminine cut. They also do some kind of neat sewing in the armpits (oh yeah, ""gussets"") that keeps the jacket in place when you lift up your arms, reach out, stretch, etc. I am 5'8"", 125 # and the Small hits just below my waist. The back is slightly longer, which keeps the jacket from looking too short. If you want a jacket that covers your tummy or hits at your hips, this isn't it.As mentioned there are no cuff zips/adjustments, and the zippers aren't covered. The collar won't cover your chin, and there's no hood. However... if you want major coverage, waterproof zips, cuffs that accommodate gloves, etc, you're really looking for a full-on 3-in-1 jacket or insulated rain jacket, you know?I've had this for over 2 years and it shows no signs of wear. It machine-washes beautifully and dries quickly. In the future I may splurge and upgrade to a hooded jacket with more bells and whistles. But I will definitely get another Arcteryx product, because for the weight, they're super warm, and worth the $$.",307,1,0,0,0,1,,2020,11,26,4,304
r0095,2020-03-01,1665,5,Great jacket,"I'm 5'2"", 115#. Got the small. Slightly big on me, but purposely so as I like to be able to layer underneath and use for spring skiing and backcountry. Transitions from skiing to wandering around town, so can be a one jacket solution in shoulder seasons. Jacket is reasonably waterproof and I can only feel the wind if it's excessive. Very lightweight, easy to move in, doesn't ride up, and warm considering it's thickness. Highly recommended.",76,1,1,1,1,0,,2020,3,1,2,76
r0096,2020-02-27,1668,2,Prefer old Gamma AR.,"I am 5'8"", med/slim, with orangutan-length arms. I have worn a men's Gamma-AR size small for years for all-weather bike-commuting and backcountry skiing, and loved it. The new NOT-made-in-Canada versions now have new and extra seams in strange places (if you're concerned with shedding moisture, for example, or rubbing/friction), no zipper garages, less-elastic sleeve openings (read: more difficult to tuck in one's gloves underneath), less-smooth finish to the fabric (noisy), and an overall puffier if longer fit. I tried the men's as usual first, and the fit was just not right. So I tried the women's style. I like the light-green/yellow color (for visibility). Size large almost fit me in the body (although slightly loose), but the sleeves were short, shorter than I'd have expected by comparing the various size charts. X-Large finally almost fit in the sleeve length but was way too big in the body for me [I returned both]. Probably still a good jacket for leisure, but new version is no longer as good for hardcore use, IMHO. So I'll keep using my old one and I'll be on the lookout for vintage Gamma ARs.",188,0,2,1,1,0,,2020,2,27,4,188
r0097,2020-02-16,1679,3,Way too short!,"I'm 5'8 120 lbs and the jacket only came right below my belly button...the back length was sufficient, but I wish that the front was as long as the back. I had to send it back.",36,0,2,1,1,0,,2020,2,16,3,36
r0098,2020-01-27,1699,3,Not what I hoped,"First off, let me say that I get compliments on this jacket every time I wear it. I guess it looks cool, or maybe it???s just the label. I love how stretchy the fabric is and how light it is in weight. I don???t love how light it is as far as insulating goes. This jacket isn???t much better than a windbreaker for keeping warm and it is worse if you want to put your hands in the pockets. I???m sure the pockets are supposed to serve the dual purpose of offering ventilation or storing things but I don???t like having to choose between sheltering my hands and exposing my torso to the elements. I like separate ventilation zippers, a separate pocket to store things and pockets for my hands. I think Arcteryx is overrated but the jacket is fine and the material is cool because it really does allow a lot of freedom of movement and it blocks the wind pretty well. I got a killer deal at Backcountry.com but if I would have paid full price, I???d have been pissed.",182,0,0,0,0,1,,2020,1,27,4,182
r0099,2020-01-15,1711,5,No complaints here,"I wanted a soft shell jacket that was water resistant and could protect me from the wind. This definitely has it all. I purchased the fuchsia, which is more like raspberry in color, but it looks great. It's tailored nicely and I can move real easily in it. All of the seams are taped and the zippers are hidden zipped up. I love the fact the back is slightly longer than the front, so when I bend down the jacket doesn't come up giving me a nice shot of cold air on the backside. I can't wait to thoroughly put it through its paces when the spring comes and I go hiking. I do admit, I thought it might have been a bit more thicker with more fleece lining. I like the softness of the collar so on windy, cold days it won't give me rug burn on my chin and neck. Overall, a solid jacket.",156,1,1,1,0,1,,2020,1,15,3,156
