r0001,1/12/2020,1714,5,Awesome,The color is a tad greener(turquoise) than it seems on the picture... it's indeed a cool color! When I'm out in the slopes people constantly asks me where I got my gear from. I've combinated the jacket with the 686 Mannual Bliss Insulated Pant in Orchid Denim.... sounds like it wouldn't be a good match but it's great!!! Suitable for a person that want to be in-fashion and warm.,69,positive,0,0,0,0,1
r0002,11/27/2019,1760,5,rad jacket.,"Awesome winter jacket. Perfect for a wintery day or out on the slopes. Very cute, affordable and comfy!",18,positive,0,0,0,0,NA
r0003,6/2/2019,1938,5,A fit that's hard to find,"I am 5'11"" and have a pretty solid, athletic build from the Army. It's tough to find winter clothing that doesn't make me look the size of a man or have sleeves too short.This jacket is well-fitted to my figure, allowing for a slender, curvy outline. The length of the torso and sleeves are adequate for me, as well. I've had this jacket for over six months, and it's been holding up perfectly. The quality of the materials and design feels like a $300 jacket. I haven't had a problems with waterproofness or breathability. I got the one called Black Dot Pin, but it isn't actually black; it has a dark purple base, and the lighter accents are a light lavender.",122,positive,0,0,1,0,NA
r0004,1/17/2019,2074,5,awesome jacket!,this is my new fav jacket. it fits true to size and the details on there are amazing. i got the black w/ pink one and the picture doesnt do the jacket justice. the length of this jacket is perfect... its not too short and its not too long. if youre looking for the perfect snowboarding jacket then look no further.,61,positive,2,1,1,0,2
r0005,11/17/2019,1770,3,yeahhuh,"i'm a small person, a very small person, about 5'3 and 100 pounds. see I got this jacket in a medium, because I like to wear baggy clothes in the park, the only thing large about it is the shoulders, and it runs short, like high up on the waist. but its super steezy, so i guess if your smaller then me, you should get it or something, i like it. its warm and what not...",76,negative,0,0,0,0,3
r0006,5/6/2021,1234,5,Great running jacket,"I purchased a similar pullover in the same material a few years back and found this zip up one and had to get one. It is a great wind-stopper, and the honey-comb inside material keeps the jacket from sticking to you if you sweat a lot. It is not as breathable as some other jackets, but it stops a chilly wind much better. Very comfortable and it is longer (on me, 5'4"") if you like that type of jacket.",79,positive,0,0,0,0,NA
r0007,3/30/2019,2002,5,highly recommended!!,"This jacket is super-lightweight but still completely durable. I wore it on a backcountry ski trip in Whistler and it was perfect for blocking the wind at the peak. i wore it with a baselayer and softshell and was very comfortable, on both a snowy day as well as blue sky. I did a lot of falling in deep powder (shocker!) and I managed to stay completely dry- the performance of this jacket lived up to the high quality that Arc'teryx prides itself on. Awesome!!",85,positive,0,0,1,0,4
r0008,3/20/2021,1281,5,Best all-around jacket,"Best all-around jacket. I use it for hiking/backpacking, snowsports (skiing, snowshoe excursions), running & biking. Works Amazingly in the wind - I absolutely love the taped seams (especially when on the bike). The velcro around the wrists works wonderfully - I never have to be concerned with my gloves sneeking out. I love the higher neck that really helps out in the cold winds. I have worn this jacket in the Palouse of Washington and Idaho (WIND) and currently up in Alaska (WIND, COLD, and WET). Great length in the arms (a little longer than most jackets) and covers the waistline.",101,positive,0,0,0,0,NA
r0009,7/23/2020,1521,5,Super light!,"I have the Alpha SL, Alpha LT, and Beta SL. They all fit true to size. I recommend the Alpha SL and LT for active pursuits and the Beta SL as an around town/casual shell/jacket. The Alpha SL is superlight. The PacLite fabric is nice, although the LT has an even better feel (Pro-Shell). I definitely recommend the Alpha SL, expecially if you're on a budget. But take a look at the Alpha LT if you want the next step up.",81,positive,0,0,1,1,5
r0010,4/26/2020,1609,5,Best summer storm jacket I know of!,"I hate to gush, but this is my second of the same jacket - in a different color! It is so light, good looking, and most important of all, has kept me warm and dry in the worst of storms at high elevation in Colorado. I work in the field and this is one of the best finds ever - go Arc Teryx! A grateful Botanist who firmly believes the saying - ""there's no bad weather, only bad gear"" - or something like that!

r0011,4/15/2020,1620,5,saved my marriage.,"well my marriage was not really in jeopardy but wife digs it.I kinda hesitated on the paclite vs a goretex pro......but honestly, she has skied in it, wore it in the rain.......of course and it is always comfortable for her.",41,positive,0,0,0,1,6
r0012,1/22/2020,1704,5,"Versatile, Attractive Jacket",I bought this jacket in green and it is a gorgeous lime color...the zipper and material aren't really so different in color like the photo shows. I am a size small and bought a medium so I could wear it over a couple underlayers/polarfleece and it fits perfectly. I love the placement of the pockets and the ventilation zippers. I often wear it cross country skiing over a fleece or as a stand-alone jacket on warmer Minnesota winter days. I can tell it's going to be a great rain jacket too...100% waterproof! EXCELLENT quality for the price!,97,positive,0,0,1,0,7
r0013,1/14/2020,1712,5,Shweeet Jacket,"This jacket is grand. I had originally bought the women's stoic event shell, but it didnt fit properly...so i decided to get this jacket while it was on sale. It fits perfectly. I am 5'4"" and 120 and got the small and i can still fit a jacket underneath for layering. If you want to use this jacket for skiing or such, I would recommend sizing up because a thicker jacket underneath might be a little cramped. I love the sprig color (bright green...you cant miss me). Oh and the waterproof is awesome. I havent had any problems with condensation on the inside of the jacket.",106,positive,0,0,0,0,8
r0014,1/13/2020,1713,3,Poor fit,"I can't really say anything about use in the field. I got a large that should have fit per the sizing chart, and I should have had a bit of room to spare for under layers. It was tight across the back of the shoulders. Would not be comfortable for ski or snowshoe activities.",54,negative,0,0,0,0,9
r0015,12/26/2019,1731,2,Review Title,"I do love this jacket - perfect fit for me-- BUT- I bought it in September and to day (28th of december) it ripped under the arm, the same happed to a friend of mine who has the excat same jacket! Luckily i can return it and get my money back - it just sucks that i have to go through the work of dooing it!",66,negative,0,0,1,1,NA
r0016,5/20/2019,1951,5,Recommended!,"Love the jacket. It was a gift, and a great one. I love the different colors they come in, I got the pink/magenta one. Great for light to medium rain, would get a different one for heavier rain. But it's perfect for me and where I live.",47,positive,0,0,1,0,NA
r0017,3/11/2019,2021,5,Great jacket,This jacket is dope. It's super light and thin but really windproof. Perfect for warmer spring days when you don't want something heavy but it's windy on top of the mountain. The thin fleece lining inside the collar is great for protecting your face against wind.,46,positive,0,0,0,0,NA
r0018,2/16/2019,2044,5,this jacket rocks,I love this coat. Its everything it said it would be. My favorite features are the high pockets (I can put my hands in them while I have my pack on) and the giant hood (it covers my whole head and protects my face even with a hat on under it). It is comfortable too! If you are thinking about it....get it!,62,positive,0,0,0,0,NA
r0019,1/25/2019,2066,3,Perhaps I Overdid it a Little....,"I must say, I gave this rain jacket the ultimate test straight from the get-go. I took it on a month long trip to Venezuela were it encountered tropical thunderstorms and a drenching boat ride to Angel Falls. I was underwhelmed with the jackets ability to repel water in these conditions (it only could take a medium amount of water). It might be better for light rain and city livin'. I wouldn't recommend this coat for hardcore outdoor activities. I ended up returning it and got a beefier jacket instead.",90,negative,3,1,0,0,NA
