## LLM System & APIs

### [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
Ollama is a free, open-source tool that allows users to run large language models (LLMs) locally on their computers. Details can be found on their [GitHub Page](https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file).

1. Download Ollama ([Windows](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe)/[macOS](https://ollama.com/download/Ollama-darwin.zip)/[Linux](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md)).
2. To use the LLMs in Ollama, you can use 
    - [ollama-python](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python), the Python library for Ollama.
    - Or use [Command Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) program. Ex., [Command Prompt](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-command-prompt/) for WindowsOS and [Terminal](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/) for macOS.
3. Let's get started with the [tutorial](https://github.com/YuxiaoLuo/AI_Intro/blob/main/tutorial_ollama.md).

## Agentic AI

### [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home)
Agent Skills provide an open, discoverable standard for extending AI agents with new capabilities. A skill packages instructions, scripts, and supporting resources into a structured format that agents can load to perform specific tasks.
At the core of each skill is a folder anchored by a `SKILL.md` file. This file defines metadata and step-by-step procedural guidance that instructs the agent how to execute a particular workflow. By standardizing how tasks are described and performed, skills enable reusable, consistent, and reliable task execution.
Skills give agents on-demand access to domain expertise and contextual knowledge, helping bridge capability gaps and support repeatable, auditable workflows across compatible platforms. Because the format is open and portable, skill creators can build capabilities once and deploy them across multiple agents—while preserving organizational knowledge in version-controlled, shareable packages.

### [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant that runs on your own devices and integrates directly into messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Teams, and more, so you can interact with it through the channels you already use. It operates locally and continuously, with voice support on macOS, iOS, and Android, plus a live Canvas interface you can control, while the Gateway serves only as the control plane behind the assistant. Setup is easiest through the terminal onboarding wizard (`openclaw onboard`), which walks you through configuring the gateway, channels, and skills, and it supports subscriptions like Anthropic Claude and OpenAI models for advanced capabilities.

### [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n)
n8n is a workflow automation platform that enables the development of agentic AI systems. It supports the construction of AI agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines through extensive, highly flexible integrations with a wide range of software tools.

### [Google Opal](https://opal.google/)
Google Opal is a no-code agentic AI platform for creating mini-AI apps. It connects AI models (like Gemini) with tools and prompts to automate tasks and create content without writing code. Users create visual workflows with steps like user input, generative AI, and outputs (which can go to Docs/Sheets), then publish them as shareable web apps for personal or collaborative use.
